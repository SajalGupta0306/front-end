<!-- Canvas
	The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
	The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
	Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
	The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.

	Resolution dependent.
	No support for event handlers.
	Poor text rendering capabilities.
	You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg.
	Well suited for graphic-intensive games.

<!-- SVG
	The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics.
	SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.
	SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML.

	Resolution independent.
	Support for event handlers.
	Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (Google Maps).
	Slow rendering if complex (anything that uses the DOM a lot will be slow).
	Not suited for game applications.
