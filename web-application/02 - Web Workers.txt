Web Workers
    It is a JavaScript script executed from an HTML page that runs in the background,
        independently of scripts that may also have been executed from the same HTML page.
    It doesn't have access to :
        window object
        document object
        parent object
    It has access to :
        navigator object (useragent, geolocation, cookieenabled)
        location object (host, hostname, href, pathname, etc)
        xhr
        setTimeout/setInterval
        Application cache

    
    var worker = new Worker("worker_script.js");

    To send a message to the worker, the postMessage method of the worker object is used as shown below.

    worker.postMessage("Hello World!");

    The onmessage property uses an event handler to retrieve information from a worker.

    worker.onmessage = function(event) {
        alert("Received message " + event.data);
        doSomething();
    }
        
    function doSomething() {
        //do work
        worker.postMessage("Work done!");
    }

    worker.terminate();
