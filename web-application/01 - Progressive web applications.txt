Progressive web applications
    Websites that can be added as apps for offline access.
    Key principles -
        Discoverable, so the contents can be found through search engines.
        Installable, so it can be available on the device's home screen or app launcher.
        Linkable, so you can share it by sending a URL.
        Network independent, so it works offline or with a poor network connection.
        Progressively enhanced, so it's still usable on a basic level on older browsers, but fully-functional on the latest ones.
        Re-engageable, so it's able to send notifications whenever there's new content available.
        Responsively designed, so it's usable on any device with a screen and a browserâ€”mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, refrigerators, etc.
        Secure, so the connections between the user, the app, and your server are secured against any third parties trying to access sensitive data.
