Web Storage
	It provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs.

	getItem(key)
	setItem(key, value)
	removeItem(key)
	clear()

	sessionStorage -
		It maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session
			(as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores).
		Data is never transferred to the server.
		Storage limit is larger than a cookie (at most 5MB).

		Code -
			sessionStorage.colorSetting = '#a4509b';
			sessionStorage['colorSetting'] = '#a4509b';
			sessionStorage.setItem('colorSetting', '#a4509b');

	localStorage -
		It does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.
		It gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser cache / Locally Stored Data.
		Storage limit is the maximum amongst the two.

		Code -
			localStorage.colorSetting = '#a4509b';
			localStorage['colorSetting'] = '#a4509b';
			localStorage.setItem('colorSetting', '#a4509b');
